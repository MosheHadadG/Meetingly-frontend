# Welcome to Meetingly

## Project Description

In the project I have developed, I created an application that allows users to search for and connect with partners for shared activities. The application provides a user-friendly interface that enables users to create new events, add photos, descriptions, and additional details. Users can also filter events based on interests, geographic distance, or search events using the search bar.

The events in the application can be public or private. Public events are open for anyone to join without requiring approval from the event initiator, while private events require approval from the event initiator to join.

The application includes a chat system that allows users to communicate efficiently and in real-time. The group chat feature enables users who have joined the same event to communicate with all other participants. The private chat feature allows users to communicate privately with each other.

Additionally, there is a notification system that provides real-time updates to users about events they initiated (such as event cancellations or joining requests) and events they received joining requests for. The application also includes a calendar that displays focused information about the events users have joined, including dates, start and end times.

The application provides a platform for event management and communication, allowing users to create, find, and participate in events in a convenient and efficient manner.
